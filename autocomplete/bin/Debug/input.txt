it only remains to indicate the part which she had played throughout there can be no doubt that stapleton exercised an influence over her which may have
been love or may have been fear or very possibly both since they are by no means incompatible emotions it was at least absolutely effective
at his command she consented to pass as his sister though he found the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make her the direct accessory to murder
she was ready to warn sir henry so far as she could without implicating her husband and again and again she tried to do so
stapleton himself seems to have been capable of jealousy and when he saw the baronet paying court to the lady even though it was part of his own plan still he could not help
interrupting with a passionate outburst which revealed the fiery soul which his self-contained manner so cleverly concealed
by encouraging the intimacy he made it certain that sir henry would frequently come to merripit house and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he desired
on the day of the crisis however his wife turned suddenly against him she had learned something of the death of the convict and she knew that the hound was being kept in the
outhouse on the evening that sir henry was coming to dinner she taxed her husband with his intended crime and a furious scene followed in which he showed her for the first time
that she had a rival in his love her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter hatred and he saw that she would betray him he tied her up therefore that she might have no chance
of warning sir henry and he hoped no doubt that when the whole countryside put down the baronet's death to the curse of his family as they certainly would do he could win his
wife back to accept an accomplished fact and to keep silent upon what she knew in this i fancy that in any case he made a miscalculation and that if we had not been there his
doom would none the less have been sealed a woman of spanish blood does not condone such an irjury so lightly and now my dear watson without referring to my notes i cannot give
you a more detailed account of this curious case i do not know that anything essential has been left unexplained
